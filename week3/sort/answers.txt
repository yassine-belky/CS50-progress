sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: 'sort1' is the fastest compiled code when running on 'sorted50000.txt'. And the bubble sort is the fastest sorting algorithm when it comes to best case scenarios (already sorted arrays)

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: 'sort2' is the fastest compiled code when running on 'reversed50000.txt'. And the merge sort is the fastest sorting algorithm when it comes to worst case scenarios (inversly sorted arrays)

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: 'sort3' is the slowest compiled code when running on 'sorted50000.txt'. And the selection sort is the slowest sorting algorithm when it comes to best case scenarios (already sorted arrays)
