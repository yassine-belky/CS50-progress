# CS50-progress
This repo is used to keep track of any progress on the CS50 course


Each person will have their own branch, where they can organize their work by course or assignment.

# Getting Started
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Create your personal branch by running the following command:

```bash 
git branch <your-name>
git checkout <your-name>
```

# Organizing Your Work
Each branch should be organized by folders for each course or assignment of the specialization. For example, if you are working on the problem set for Week 1, you would create a folder called "week1" and add all of your work for that problem set to that folder.



# Course Schedule
The CS50 course is a 11-week course. The progress should be tracked as follows:

|Week | Course |  Progress |
|---|---|---|
| Week 0 | Scratch | DONE |
| Week 1 | C | DONE |
| Week 2 | Arrays | ONGOING |
| Week 3 | Algorithms | TODO |
| Week 4 | Memory | TODO |
| Week 5 | Data Structures | TODO |
| Week 6 | Python | TODO |
| Week 7 | SQL | TODO |
| Week 8 | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | TODO |
| Week 9 | Flask | TODO |
| Week 10 | Emoji | TODO |
| Week 11 | Cybersecurity | TODO |



# Collaboration
* After you have completed work on a problem set or assignment, you should commit and push your work to your personal branch.
  * To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use : 

  ```bash
  git push --set-upstream origin <your-branch-name>
  ```


* If you would like to collaborate with other members of the group, you can create a pull request from your branch to the master branch. This allows other members of the group to review and merge your changes.
